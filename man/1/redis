.SH NAME
redis \- A client for the Redis database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B redis
[
.B -i
] [
.BI -a " addr"
] [
.BI -d " db#"
] [
.BI -e " cmd1" [-e " cmd2" ...]
] [
.BI -q " quotechar"
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I redis
is a client for the Redis in-memory database.  Commands can be entered interactively and passed through
the
.I -e
flag.

Quoting is done with
.I "
and embedded quotes are done by doubling the quote character, as in the shell.
(Note that this differs from the official client that ships with Redis, which
uses backslash.)

.TP
.BI -a " addr"
The address to connect to.  The default is 
.I tcp!localhost!6379
, the default port for Redis servers.

.TP
.BI -d " db#"
The database number to connect to.  The default is
.I 0.
See
.B BUGS
for a small caveat.

.TP
.BI -i
Force interactive mode.  The default is to prompt interactively unless any
commands are specified with the
.I -e
option.

.TP
.BI -e " cmd"
Send a command to the server.  This option can be specified multiple times.

.TP
.BI -q " quotechar"
Change the quote character from the default.

.SH BUGS
This is alpha software.  The author has used it and it seems fine.  Some things
are missing.
.PP
The
.BI SELECT
command is not interpreted specially, so the prompt does not update if you
select a different DB interactively.
.PP
Maybe the prompt should be more minimal and shouldn't mimic the default client's prompt anyway.
.PP
The server is generally trusted.
.PP
Error reporting is poor at the moment.
.PP
Redis loves to litter the output with carriage returns.  On a vt100 emulator
this is less noticeable, but the
.B INFO
command is going to be ugly for anyone running this in a shell window or under
.IR acme (1).
.PP
At present, if you want to use 
.B PUBLISH
or
.B SUBSCRIBE
you will have to issue repeated
.B PING
commands to get the results.  This may get fixed, but using the FS interface or
the library might be more prudent than using the interactive command if you
are doing things like Pub/Sub.  (
.B BRPOP
and friends work just fine, though.)
