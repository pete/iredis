.SH DESCRIPTION
.I redis
is a client for the Redis in-memory database.  For more information on Redis,
see https://redis.io/.  Commands can be entered interactively and passed through
the
.I -e
flag.

Quoting is done with a single
.I '
and embedded quotes are done with a double-quote, as in the shell.

.TP
.BI -a " addr"
The address to connect to.  The default is 
.I tcp!localhost!6379
, the default port for Redis servers.

.TP
.BI -d " db#"
The database number to connect to.  The default is
.I 0.
See
.B BUGS
for a small caveat.

.TP
.BI -i
Force interactive mode.  The default is to prompt interactively unless any
commands are specified with the
.I -e
option.

.TP
.BI -e " cmd"
Send a command to the server.  This option can be specified multiple times.

.SH BUGS
This is alpha software.  The author has used it and it seems fine.
.PP
The interface is not yet done.
.PP
There is, of course, no support (present or planned) for Unix sockets.
.PP
The
.BI SELECT
command is not interpreted specially, so the prompt does not update if you
select a different DB.
.PP
The server is generally trusted.
.PP
Error reporting is poor at the moment.
