- Inferno Redis Client:  An Apparently Working Software Release

This is a library and an interactive client for the Inferno operating system 
(http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/index.html) that allows it to talk to Redis
(https://redis.io/).  That is, it is a native version of Redis's bundled
`redis-cli` tool and an easy-to-use client library.

I use Redis for fun and profit, as well as Inferno.  I wanted to talk to Redis
from Inferno without using os(10).  I am currently using the interactive client
regularly.

- Installing

	% mk install

Set $ROOT if you are running mk from the host OS, you will need to supply
'ROOT=/path/to/inferno' to the mk command.

- Documentation

The command and the library have man pages.  The short version is that after you
install it, you can type 'redis' to use the interactive client.

- Future development

It'd be nice to fix some of the bugs by special-casing the commands.

The man pages could stand some polish.

A filesystem interface would be nice.
