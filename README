This code contains a library and an interactive client.  I am currently using
the interactive client daily.  I like Redis.  If you start seeing fewer updates,
that means I have found fewer bugs (either directly or by reports).

I wanted to talk to Redis from Inferno without using os(10).

Installing:  mk install.  Set $ROOT if you are doing it from outside Inferno.

API Stability:  No.  The current API is bad and wrong.

Documentation:  See the man pages.

Plans:  Less buggy, better API, better man pages.  Filesystem interface.
