- Inferno Redis Client:  An Apparently Working Software Release

This code contains a library and an interactive client for talking to Redis
(https://redis.io/) from the Inferno OS
(http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/index.html).  I am currently using the
interactive client regularly.

I use Redis for fun and profit, as well as Inferno.  I wanted to talk to Redis
from Inferno without using os(10).

- Installing

	% mk install

Set $ROOT if you are running mk from the host OS, you will need to add
'ROOT=/path/to/inferno' to the mk command.

- Documentation

The command and the library have man pages (which note some bugs).

- Future development

It'd be nice to fix some of the bugs by special-casing the commands.

The man pages could stand some help.

A filesystem interface would be nice.
